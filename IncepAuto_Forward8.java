 * This file houses Autonomous code
 * It uses the main robot class Refbot to define the hardware and driving commands
 * The code is structured as a LinearOpMode
 *
 * The code REQUIRES that you DO have encoders on the wheels
 *
 *  This code ALSO requires that the drive Motors have been configured such that a positive
 *  power command moves them forwards, and causes the encoders to count UP.
 *
 *
 *  See the Refbot class for encode-based driving controls that perform the actual movement.
